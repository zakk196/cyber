3rd party apps do care becasue they need to know what app to open.



nano script01.sh - will run a script file on terminal.



./script01.sh- will run the script



chmod 770 script01.sh- ch mod will change permission script is the file and 770 is the perrmision exampe r4ead write.





ls -la- will show the current permissions.
